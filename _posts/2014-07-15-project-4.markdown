situation: '<p align="left"> <b>Situation</b>: A reputed hotel wants to understand the sentiment of their customers towards their brand before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. They have hired you as a data scientist to perform a sentiment analysis on tweets related to their hotel before and after the pandemic, and to extract relevant tweets for further analysis. </p>'

task: '<p align="left"> <b>Task</b>: Your task is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to the hotel before and after the pandemic, and to extract relevant tweets using suitable techniques.

action: '<p align="left"> <b>Action</b>: To complete the project, you take the following actions: <br><br>

1. Data collection: You collect tweets related to the hotel before and after the pandemic using a suitable data scraping tool such as Tweepy or Scrapy. You also filter the tweets to ensure they are relevant to the hotel. <br><br>

2. Data preprocessing: You preprocess the tweets using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming to convert them into a consistent format for analysis. You also handle issues such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and emoticons. <br><br>

3. Sentiment analysis: You perform sentiment analysis on the tweets using suitable techniques such as TextBlob, VADER, or machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes or SVM. You classify the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the sentiment scores. <br><br>

4. Trend analysis: You analyze the sentiment trends over time by aggregating the sentiment scores into weekly or monthly intervals. You plot the sentiment trends using suitable visualization techniques such as line charts or heatmaps. <br><br>

5. Tweet extraction: You extract relevant tweets for further analysis using techniques such as keyword search, hashtag analysis, or user mentions. You also use tools such as NLP or regex to extract specific information such as customer feedback or complaints. </p>'

The report includes insights such as the most common sentiments, sentiment polarity, sentiment distribution, and sentiment trends over time. The hotel can use this report to improve their customer service, marketing strategy, and reputation management, helping them to better understand their customers sentiments and preferences. </p>'
